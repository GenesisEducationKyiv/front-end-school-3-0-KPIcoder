# Music Player App

## Notes:
- Header search bar and icons just for aesthetics
- Play button is for aesthetics, since the server doesn't stream the audio file
- The uploaded file can be played using the native `audio` player (not aesthetically nice, but simple in implementation)
- Bulk delete implemented
- Data fetching is separated from the components
- UI lib used: `tanstack/router`, `tanstack/react-query`, `shadcn`, `lucia`

### P.S: Overall I am not very happy, as I could have done it better if I had more free time. I spent 6 hours on it
