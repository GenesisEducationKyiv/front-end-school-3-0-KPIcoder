# Music Player App

### For the person who is going to review it:
Please reach out to me (tg @kpicoder) and I can guide you through the project.
I would like to explain the bugs, features, approaches and WIP functionality.

## Notes:
- Header search bar and icons just for aesthetics
- Audio streaming fixed
- The uploaded file can be played via action menu `Play` option
- Bulk delete implemented
- Data fetching is separated from the components
- Transport agnostic (rpc / rest). Can be configured in the `config`
- Tested with `vitest` and `playwright`
- UI lib used: `tanstack/router`, `tanstack/react-query`, `shadcn`, `lucia`, `zustand`

Deployed app: http://167.99.5.213:4173/
