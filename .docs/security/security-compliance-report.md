#  Dependency Security Compliance Report

##  Overview

This document certifies that all project dependencies comply with modern security standards. The project is continuously monitored using **GitHub Dependabot** and **CodeQL** to ensure no known vulnerabilities are present.

##  Security Standards

-  **Automatic security audit** of dependencies is enabled and runs daily using Dependabot.
-  All package updates are handled via automated pull requests created by Dependabot.
-  Static code analysis is performed using CodeQL to detect vulnerabilities in custom application code.

##  Checks Performed

| Check                                           | Status      | Tool           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Known vulnerabilities in third-party packages   | ✅ None      | Dependabot     |
| Presence of zero-day vulnerabilities            | ✅ None\*    | Dependabot     |
| Code-level vulnerability scanning               | ✅ Passed    | CodeQL         |

> \* Dependabot cannot detect unpublished zero-day vulnerabilities. However, it is updated daily from the GitHub Advisory Database and can identify newly disclosed threats as soon as they are reported.

##  Update Policy

-  **Daily checks** for updated versions and new vulnerabilities.
-  Automatic pull requests are created with the prefix `chore` and must pass CodeQL analysis before being merged.

##  Conclusion

As of the latest scan, the project has **no known vulnerable dependencies**, **meets security compliance standards**, and is equipped with **automated tools** to detect and respond to security threats promptly.
